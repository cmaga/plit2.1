They must be capable of performing wire inspections in either direction between revenue trains during off-peak hours, and provide the ability to record and transfer wire inspection results. Additionally the MBTA now desires a second trailer car with an OCS Wire spool and a bucket lift to support wire replacement b) Three (3) Crane Cars will be used primarily for track and signal maintenance, including lifting and transporting equipment such as rail, special track-work, signal equipment, and related. The ability to transport rail is mandatory and it is expected that a semi-permanently coupled flat car will be required to provide sufficient storage. NEW: Additionally the MBTA is considering the addition of a non-powered flat car pair for use with the crane car PURPOSE: This cost estimate is intended for capital planning purposes only to support Capital Investment planning. It is anticipated that this estimate will be updated, revised and modified based on the information and data obtained during the Request for Industry Information process that is currently underway.
