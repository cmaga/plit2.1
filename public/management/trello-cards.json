They must be capable of performing wire inspections in either direction between revenue trains during off-peak hours, and provide the ability to record and transfer wire inspection results. Additionally the MBTA now desires a second trailer car with an OCS Wire spool and a bucket lift to support wire replacement b) Three (3) Crane Cars will be used primarily for track and signal maintenance, including lifting and transporting equipment such as rail, special track-work, signal equipment, and related. The ability to transport rail is mandatory and it is expected that a semi-permanently coupled flat car will be required to provide sufficient storage. NEW: Additionally the MBTA is considering the addition of a non-powered flat car pair for use with the crane car PURPOSE: This cost estimate is intended for capital planning purposes only to support Capital Investment planning.
